### **Phase 8: Deploying Applications**
1. **Hosting Platforms**
   - Deploying to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
2. **Package Management**
   - Using npm/yarn efficiently.

---

### **Getting Started with Lessons**
We'll begin with **Phase 1**, breaking each concept into small, understandable sections. Letâ€™s start by installing Node.js and running your first script.

---

#### **Lesson 1: Installing Node.js and Running Your First Script**

1. **Installing Node.js**
   - Visit the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version for stability.
   - Install the package on your system.

2. **Checking Installation**
   Open your terminal and type the following commands:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
   This will display the installed version of Node.js.

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```
   This will display the installed version of npm (Node Package Manager).

3. **Writing Your First Script**
   Create a file called `app.js` with the following code:
   ```javascript
   // This is a basic Node.js script
   // Use the console.log() method to print messages to the console

   console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
   ```

4. **Running the Script**
   In your terminal, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
   You should see `Hello, Node.js!` printed in your terminal.
